I have a lovely dog named Bobby.He looks pretty with short legs,big ears and short tail.He is my good friend and he
is also easy to take care of.I walk him at least twice a day,feed him and spend time with him.He also gives his love
to me in return.
He is always there to lick me and lie on me.I like playing with him.I think he can tell when I am happy,sad,angry or
troubled.Sometimes he can be noisy and run around the room.In a word,he is not only my dog,but also my friend.
I love him. He can roll on the floor. He can play balls with me. He can look after my house when I am out. Bobby is
very clever. But sometimes he isn’t.
One day Bobby runs away. He is out for three days. After he comes back, I tie him to a tree and give him some food.
Bobby begins to eat. But then he stops. He sees a fox. The fox is looking at his food. Bobby barks and barks. He
wants to catch the fox. But he can’t. The fox runs round the tree. Bobby runs after the fox. So the rope goes ground
the tree. Of course Bobby can’t run. Quickly he eats up the food and runs away.
